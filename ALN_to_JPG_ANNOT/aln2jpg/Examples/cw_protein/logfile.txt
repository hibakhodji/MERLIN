Input files: Test_data/PROTEIN.fa were written to one fasta file: Examples/cw_protein/ADOMA_PROTEIN.fa
Prefix is defined as: ADOMA_PROTEIN, type of sequences is defined as: PROTEIN
There are extra ClustalW options defined: -gapopen=30 -gapext=5 -seqnos=ON
Extra colored output for the Clustal W alignment is requested

ClustalW alignment:



 CLUSTAL 2.1 Multiple Sequence Alignments


Sequence type explicitly set to Protein

Convert ClustalW alignment to different output files with python script: convert_aln.py
